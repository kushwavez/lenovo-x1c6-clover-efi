## BIOS settings:

- CSM: Disabled
- Virtualization, VT-d: Enabled
- Hyper-Threading: Enabled
- Anti-Theft: Disabled
- Intel SGX: Software Controlled
- Disable Fingerprint at I/O
- Thunderbolt device: Enabled
- For Thunderbolt 3 hot-plug (higher power consumption):
  - Thunderbolt BIOS Assist Mode: Disabled
  - Security Level: No security
  - Support in Pre Boot Environment: Disabled
- For Thunderbolt 3 without hot-plug (lower power consumption but need to plug your device before boot)
  - Thunderbolt BIOS Assist Mode: Enabled

## What is working?
- AirDrop, Handoff (only with Broadcom cards)
- iCloud, Messages, App Store, FaceTime, etc.
- Instant WiFi Hotspot with iPhone (only with original Apple Broadcom cards, such as BCM94360CS2)
- Intel UHD 620 (QE/CI, hardware decode/encode, VP9, HDMI)
- Sound (incl. combo-jack, HDMI out)
- Thunderbolt 3 (with hot-plug support)
- USB ports
- Ethernet dongle
- TrackPad, TrackPoint and Keyboard (incl. native multi-gestures, FN keys)
- FileVault
- Battery (~0.5 W when TB3 hot-plug is disabled, ~2W when enabled)
- Sleep
- Power Management
- Webcam
- SD card reader

## What isn't working?
- Fingerprint reader
- Hibernation
  - I think it's fixable, but just not worth the trouble for me. Just use normal sleep (hibernationmode=3) like on real MacBooks
- Original Samsung PM NVMe SSD
  - Causing kernel panics. Not fixable, replace your drive with an aftermarket one. I used KINGSTON A2000 and WDC PC SN720, but feel free to choose anything other than Samsung
  
## Issues:
- With Intel wifi the Bluetooth is not functioning properly, AirDrop is not working. Recommended to replace it with an original Apple BCM94360CS2 card to get fully-working functionality like on real Macs
- HDMI isn't working if you start the system with plugged in, disconnect before start and reconnect it after macOS is up and running. 
  - Fixable with EDID patch
- HDMI breaks after sleep/wake, need to re-plug
  - Fixable with EDID patch
- Audio sometimes just goes blank at random (rarely): A quick lid close/open solves this, issue needs to be debugged and reported to the Acidanthera team
- Thunderbolt 3 (I only have an ADT-Link R43SG-TB3 device with RX 470, so maybe other devices are good, but I don't have more TB3 devices to test with):
  - If you disconnect the eGPU the notebook will freeze (high CPU usage), you need to restart
  - After sleep hot-plug is not working with the TB3 eGPU (device not detected)
    - Workaround: Plug the TB3 in, put the notebook into sleep, wake it up. It may fail sometimes, try it again if that is the case


## Installation:
- Create a macOS USB Installer with any method you now.
    - For creating Monterey Installer USB on Windows, use my guide: <a href="https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/346703-guide-creating-clover-macos-big-sur-installer-usb-on-windows/" target="_blank">[GUIDE] Creating Clover macOS Monterey Installer USB on Windows</a>
    - On macOS you can download the macOS Installer from App Store, or with <a href="https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS" target="_blank">gibMacOS</a>, and create the USB Installer with the official <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201372" target="_blank">"createinstallmedia"</a> method
    - On Windows you can create High Sierra - Catalina Installer USB with gibMacOS
- Mount your USB‚Äôs EFI and paste my CLOVER and BOOT folder from my bootpack
folder to it
    - On Windows you can mount your USB‚Äôs EFI with MiniTool Partition Wizard
        - Open MiniTool, select your USB drive‚Äôs EFI partition, right click, select ‚ÄúChange Letter‚Äù, Click OK, Apply, OK
    - After that you can manage the EFI using Explorer++ in administrator mode
    - On macOS you can use Terminal to mount, or use EFI Mountain Snow.app to mount your USB EFI
    - If there is no EFI folder inside the EFI partition you need to create that first
 
Example Structure:

</p>

- After finished, next step is to boot the Installer USB
    - I suggest to boot with config_debug.plist because if anything will go wrong you‚Äôll see the logs of what causing that. 
    - In Clover, select ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù below the partitions, select ‚ÄúConfigs‚Äù, then select ‚Äúconfig_debug.plist‚Äù 
- Install macOS 
    - Don‚Äôt forget to boot from your USB after restarts 
        - If you install Monterey boot from Preboot only! 
- After installing you need to mount your USB‚Äôs EFI and your System Drive‚Äôs EFI then copy the CLOVER and BOOT folder to your System Drive‚Äôs EFI  
    - (again, if there is no EFI folder, you need to create it first) 
- Unmount and remove your USB Installer and restart your system 

## Post Installation
- Open up your config.plist with Clover Configurator.app, on SMBIOS tab, generate new SMBIOS, then you can log-in to iServices now
- Download <a href="https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC">YogaSMC.app</a> to manage your fan speed, charging threshold, other SMC related things
